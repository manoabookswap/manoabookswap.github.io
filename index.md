# About ManoaBookSwap

## Overview

The problem: Textbooks are expensive and used textbooks at a reasonable price are hard to find. While your friends may be a good source of used books to buy from, there are around 20,000 other students who could provide some deals.

The solution: Manoa Book Swap is a meteor application that provides a means for UH Manoa students to communicate their textbooks needs, whether they are selling or buying.

Users create profiles which show their major and courses taken. These profiles will allow users to have listings of books they are willing to sell as well as listings they may be interested in. When two users have met each others requirements, the buyer can accept the listing and the user holding the listing can schedule a meet up time and location for the transaction.

##  Mockup Page Ideas

- A landing page which gives a brief description of the application and allows for new users to create a profile and returning users to login
- A home page which shows the main menu and some listings
- A user profile page which shows account specific information (current user listings/wishlist)
- A search page to search listing based on criteria such as major and classes, price, etc.
- A listing creation page to put up a book for sale
- An Admin login and profile page, which has ability to manage the listings
- FAQ page
- Terms and conditions page

## Use Case Ideas

- The user is directed to landing page to sign up/login. Once they are authenticated, they will be taken to the home page.
- User then may go to the search page to enter in search criteria. Listings will appear on the page based on that criteria.
- On search results page, users can accept listings and set up a meeting time and location with the seller.
- After the user holding the listing has completed transaction, they can mark their listing as complete.
- User may also go to the post page to create a listing for their book.
- Admin logs into site, sees admin profile page which has access to the database, and can modify database (clear out old listings for example).

## Beyond the Basics

- Link up to class information sites which show required texts.
- Rating system for books and other users
- Ability to customize profile and add friends
- Messaging service within the application
- Add location to search criteria

# Development History

## Milestone 1 - Mockup development

(April 4, 2017 - April 13, 2017)

The goal of this milestone was to create a mockup of the entire project. We would be using Meteor as a means of creating this.

Milestone 1 was implemented as [ManoaBookSwap GitHub Milestone M1](https://github.com/manoabookswap/manoabookswap/issues):

## Milestone 2 - Data model development

(April 13, 2017 - April 25, 2017)

The goal of Milestone 2 is to implement the data models for the profile and books collection, along with the addition of class listings and a general UI overhaul. The data model will be implemented as a set of Javascript classes. Overall, our application will have some functionality to its pages that the user can interact with.

Milestone 2 was implemented as [ManoaBookSwap Github Milestone M2](https://github.com/manoabookswap/manoabookswap/issues)

Milestone 2 consists of 4 issues, and progress is managed via the [ManoaBookSwap Github Project 2](https://github.com/manoabookswap/manoabookswap/projects/2):
